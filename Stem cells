The book "Stem Cells in Modeling Human Genetic Diseases" was edited by Mayana Katz and Keith Okamoto from the university of Sao Paulo in Brazil. They brought together more than 20 experts on the recent development around stem cells and how they can help us to understand human genetic diseases. The book covers a range of topics from Cardiomyopathies, neurological diseases and also cancer stem cells and aims to provide an overview about the recent developments in the use of stem cells in these fields. 


The range of topics is quite broad and diverse, so the reader will get a good overview about the current state of the use of iPS in fields mentioned in the book.
