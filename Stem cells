The book "Stem Cells in Modeling Human Genetic Diseases" was published in 2015 and edited by Mayana Katz and Keith Okamoto from the university of Sao Paulo in Brazil. They brought together more than 20 experts on the recent development around stem cells and how they can help us to understand human genetic diseases. The book covers a range of topics from Cardiomyopathies, neurological diseases and also cancer stem cells and aims to provide an overview about the recent developments in the use of stem cells in these fields. 

There are certainly more genetic diseases where stem cells are used for modeling than are mentioned in the book. Still, the range of topics covered in the book is quite broad and diverse, so the reader will get a good overview about the current state of the use of iPS in the fields mentioned in the book. Each chapter starts with an introduction to the disease and explains the underlying genetic causes.
